# CMS for hosting and managing your ReadyMag pages

This is a personal project to help me manage my [ReadyMag](https://readymag.com/) pages. 
It's a simple toolset that allows me to manage nginx config and remove all unwanted trackers from exported pages.

Also, it allows me to manage favicons and preview images for social networks.
